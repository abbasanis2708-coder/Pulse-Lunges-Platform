# Medical Quiz Platform: Cardiac & NLP Simulation
*A comprehensive training platform for clinical diagnosis through audio analysis and semantic evaluation.*

## Introduction
This platform is a specialized medical training tool designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical diagnostic skills. It features two distinct assessment modules: a cardiac audio analysis engine for detecting heart pathologies, and an AI-driven NLP system to evaluate clinical reasoning through semantic analysis of student responses. The platform includes a full administrative dashboard for instructors to manage medical cases, monitor student progress, and grade assessments.

## Architecture Overview
The application is structured into a client-server model using a decoupled architecture for the AI processing module.

## Installation for Users
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <url>`
2. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.
3. Run the services: `docker-compose up -d --build`
4. Access the dashboard via your browser at: `http://localhost:8080`

## Installation for Developers
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project root.
2. **Database:** Import `database/school.sql` into your local MySQL 8.0 instance. Ensure the audio assets (MP3 files) are correctly linked in the database.
3. **Web Environment:** Configure your environment variables in `web/config.php` to connect to the database.
4. **AI Engine(Quiz 3):** 
   - The AI engine runs as a service defined in docker-compose.yml.
   - The container automatically handles dependency installation (pip install -r requirements.txt) and service startup (python app.py) upon execution.
5. Ensure the PHP frontend is configured to communicate with the Flask API endpoint defined in app/config.php (using the service name http://ia:5000/classify as the host).

## Contributor Expectations
- Follow the established PSR-12 coding standard for PHP files.
- Audio assets must be optimized for web playback and correctly referenced in the database.
- Submit bug reports with clear reproduction steps and relevant database logs.
- Branch naming convention: `feature/short-description` or `fix/short-description`.

## Project Status & Limitations
- **Availability:** This project is a private academic repository. Only a small, representative sample of the codebase and datasets has been published on GitHub for demonstration purposes.
- **NLP Performance:** The model (DrBERT) has been fine-tuned on a custom, annotated clinical dataset. While it is highly specialized and efficient for the 8 defined medical categories, it may show limitations in semantic nuance compared to general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4.
- **Language Nuance:** The model is optimized for French medical terminology. It may occasionally struggle with colloquialisms or highly complex sentence structures outside of the provided clinical context.
- **System Constraints:** Audio file latency may occur on low-bandwidth networks during the quiz modules.
- **Environment:** Session synchronization between the PHP frontend and the Flask AI service requires consistent host configuration within the Docker environment.
